/**
 * A helper for using the changes feed.
 *
 * There are two modes of operation:
 *  * {@link startOneOff} to fetch the changes from the supplied since sequence
 *    until there are no further pending changes.
 *  * {@link start} to fetch the changes from the supplied since sequence and
 *    then continuing to listen indefinitely for further new changes.
 *
 * The starting sequence ID can be changed for either mode by using
 * {@link CloudantV1.PostChangesParams.since}. By default when using:
 *  * {@link startOneOff} the feed will start from the beginning.
 *  * {@link start} the feed will start from "now".
 *
 * In either mode the {@link Stream} of changes can be terminated early by calling
 * {@link stop}.
 *
 * By default {@link ChangesFollower} will suppress transient errors indefinitely and
 * endeavour to run to completion or listen forever. For applications where that
 * behaviour is not desirable an alternate constructor is available where a
 * {@link errorTolerance} may be specified to limit the time since the last successful
 * response that transient errors will be suppressed.
 *
 * It should be noted that errors considered terminal, for example, the database not
 * existing or invalid credentials are never suppressed and will throw an exception
 * immediately.
 *
 * The {@link CloudantV1.PostChangesParams} model of changes feed options is used to configure
 * the behaviour of the {@link ChangesFollower}. However, a subset of the options are
 * invalid as they are configured internally by the implementation and will cause
 * an {@link Error} to be thrown if supplied. These invalid
 * options are:
 *  * {@link CloudantV1.PostChangesParams.descending}
 *  * {@link CloudantV1.PostChangesParams.feed}
 *  * {@link CloudantV1.PostChangesParams.heartbeat}
 *  * {@link CloudantV1.PostChangesParams.lastEventId}
 *    (use {@link CloudantV1.PostChangesParams.since} instead)
 *  * {@link CloudantV1.PostChangesParams.timeout}
 *
 *
 * Only the value of `_selector` is permitted for
 * the {@link CloudantV1.PostChangesParams.filter} option.
 * Selector based filters perform better than JS based filters and using one
 * of the alternative JS based
 * filter types will cause {@link ChangesFollower} to throw an {@link Error}.
 *
 * It should also be noted that the {@link CloudantV1.PostChangesParams.limit}
 * parameter will truncate the stream at the given number of changes in either
 * operating mode.
 *
 * The {@link ChangesFollower} requires the {@link CloudantV1} client to have
 * HTTP call and read timeouts of at least 1 minute. The default client
 * configuration has sufficiently long timeouts.
